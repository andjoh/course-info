Create student teams (one per student; assuming there is a file named 'students' in the current folder):
  teachers_pet create_student_teams --organization=uis-dat320-fall2014

Create 'labs' repositories for all the students in 'students' file:
  teachers_pet create_repos --organization=uis-dat320-fall2014 --repository=labs

Push files to each students' 'labs' repo (files are pushed from local folder):
  teachers_pet push_files --organization=uis-dat320-fall2014 --repository=labs

Create team with all students:
  teachers_pet add_to_team --members=students --organization=uis-dat320-fall2014

(Find the students team on github, select Settings for the team, and set it to only have Read Access.)
Using this team will allow students to do 'go get github.com/uis-dat320-fall2014/labs'
